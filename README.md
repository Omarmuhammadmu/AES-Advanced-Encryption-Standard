# AES-Advanced-Encryption-Standard
AES-128 is a symmetric encryption algorithm standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It operates on fixed block sizes of 128 bits and employs a 128-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data securely. AES-128 is widely used for securing sensitive data due to its strong encryption, efficiency, and resistance to most known attacks.
